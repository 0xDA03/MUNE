GUIDE FOR DIRECTORY:

Each folder (CDIX, Stairfit, and STEPIX) has the completed analysis:

	- In the main directory of each, the excel files represent the raw data results:
	
	     - For example, CDIX\A3V1 will have the CDIX analysis results, with changes in free variable per column,
		 different analysis outputs per row, and different participants in each sheet
		 
		 - These are created by running the correct "RunAnalysis_____.py in the root directory. So the CDIX files 
		 were generated by running "RunAnalysisCDIX.py"
			- These scripts go through all the data as organized in the .MEF files, runs the analysis, and organizes them
			
		 - Most of this data is not really that useful on its own, but has all of the results contained within it
		 
	- In the "Stats" directory of each folder, is the statistic summaries of the data
	
		- These include the means, the reliability coefficients, and the ICC outputs for all variabbles in the raw results
		
		- Each file and trial in the main directory has a corresponding file in the stats directory, that analyzes across all
		sheets and trials. For example:
		     - BV1.xlsx and BV2.xlsx summarize into BV_ICC.xlsx, BV_Means.xlsx, and BV_RC.xlsx
		
		- These are generated by running "Calc___.py" (found in the root directory), with files for ICC, means, and RC
			- These files MUST be run in the directory which contains the raw analysis results, and will output in the same directory
			- These files are not well written or documented, but they work. Room for improvement, but the core functionality is there
		
Outside of these folders, are all the python scripts used to generate them. We already went over the RunAnalysis and Calc files,
so here is the other files:
	- Datahandler.py:
		- Creates the class needed to import the data files. Supports MEM files and CSV files
		- MEM files found in the MEM directory, CSV files in CSV.
		     - CSV Files must be organized into headers S, A for stimulus and amplitude (I manually made most of these)
			 - MEM files are the normal MEM files
		- Usage in notebook file
	- Simulate.py allows the class CMAPSim to be used, which given paramaters generates a simulated CMAP scan
		- After simulation, the data is stored in the same way as the DataHandler class
		- Usage also in notebook file
	- CDIX.py, STEPIX.py and Stairfit.py
	    - Classes which take in Data (x, and y for CDIX and Stairfit, only y for STEPIX) and calculate the results
		- Usage in notebook file

Finally, there are some files not in this directory that I worked on, but never finished.
An example is the %error calculation file, which tries to calculate the difference between two scans
in the same way MscanFit does to calculate simulated vs real data for the fitting. Let me know if you need this
